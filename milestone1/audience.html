        <h2>Our Audience</h2>
        <h4>Who is our audience?</h4>
        <p>Our audience is primarily individuals who are active and sweat a lot, such as golfers, gymgoers, outdoor workers, etc. 
            We believe we can provide these individuals with a practical and reusable solution 
            to keep their hats dry and comfortable.</p>
        <h4>Where is our audience located?</h4>
        <p>Our audience is located throughout the nation, with a focus on urban and suburban areas where there 
            is a large population of golfers.</p>
        <h4>What is their age range?</h4>
        <p>The age range of our audience is quite broad, typically ranging from young adults in their 20s to older adults in their 80s. 
            However, the core demographic is likely between 25 and 45 years old, as this group tends to be more active whether they're 
            going to the gym
            or enjoying a round of golf.</p>
        <h4>Is it targeted more towards women or men?</h4>
        <p>The audience is targeted slightly more towards men, since there are more men who are golfers and active in outdoor sports. 
            However, our product is not specifically designed for one gender. All can use the Haddy and will benefit from it!</p>
