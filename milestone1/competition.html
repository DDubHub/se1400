        <h2>Our Competition</h2>
        <h4>Who is our competition?</h4>
        <p>Our competition is other small businesses that sell reusable sweat liners for hats, such as 
            local hat shops and online outdoor gear stores.</p>
        <h4>What do they do well?</h4>
        <p>They have established brand recognition and strong distribution due to how long they've been in business, 
            but their product does well also due to it's disposability.</p>
        <h4>What do we do better?</h4>
        <p>While our competitors have great outreach and a good reputation, their product isn't reusable and is not environmentally friendly like ours is. 
            By making a sweatliner that's washable, you can keep using it over and over again, saving money and reducing waste.</p>
