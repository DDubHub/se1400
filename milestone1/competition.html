        <h2>Our Competition and Why They're Not Really Competition</h2>
        <h4>Who is our competition?</h4>
        <p>My competition is other small businesses that sell homemade caramels and sweets, such as local candy shops and online confectionery stores, along with larger commpanies like Kraft and Werther's.</p>
        <h4>What do they do well?</h4>
        <p>They have established brand recognition and strong distribution due to how long they've been in business.
        <h4>What do we do better?</h4> <p>While our competitors have great outreach, the product isn't nearly as pure as ours. Nothing can beat a tried and true family recipe thats been around longer than any of our competitors.</p>
